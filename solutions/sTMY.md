Since Solar TMYs are derived from hourly time-series, we are pleased to include the original 20+ year-long <a href="/solutions/sSeries.html">SERIES</a> when acquiring it. Vortex TMY has been designed by concatenation of the most representative months according to industry standards and, for the sake of simplicity, all different options are included in an extremely cost-effective all-in-one package.

##When to use TMY?
