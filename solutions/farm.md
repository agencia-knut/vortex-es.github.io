##When to use Farm?

When the wind farm area is already selected but not yet the turbine locations or their class.

##Main deliverables:

WRG files for WindPro, WindFarmer, OpenWind plus Vref and TI data.

##Technical details:

- Up to 100 m resolution.
- Any height between 50 and 150 m.
- Unlimited points within the selected area.
- Wind speed histograms with their Weibull fits.
- 16 sectors wind direction rose.
- 50 years extreme wind (Vref) via 30 years Gumbel fit.
- Characteristic turbulence intensity spectra.
- Sector-wise inflow angle and vertical shear.
- Exportable to Google Earth KML, ESRI grid and WAsP WRG.
