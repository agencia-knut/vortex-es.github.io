<p class="lead">Probably the most complete modeling product on the market: long-term statistics within an area plus high-resolution temperature, mean wind, extreme wind (Vref) and turbulence maps. Now with the ability to be calibrated with measurements!</p>

## When to use FARM?

When the wind farm area is already selected but not yet the turbine locations or their class.

## Technical details:

- Fully selectable areas in size, location and orientation.
- Up to 100 m resolution.
- Any height between 50 and 150 m.
- Unlimited met. mast measurement inputs for calibration purposes.
- Unlimited turbine location outputs within the selected area.
- Wind speed histograms with their Weibull fits.
- 16 sectors wind direction rose.
- 50 years extreme wind (Vref) via 30 years Gumbel fit.
- Characteristic turbulence intensity spectra.
- Sector-wise inflow angle and vertical shear.
- Exportable to Google Earth KML, ESRI grid and WAsP WRG files for WindPro, WindFARMer, OpenWind....

## Calibrate your WRG with measurements!

Satisfied with Vortex windfield patterns but concerned about deviations from your local measurements?

Vortex Remodeling technology has been extended to 3-D not only to extrapolate your measurements over time but also to interpolate them across space at sites where one or more meteorological masts are available.

How does it work?

3D-Remodeling is the natural extension of (<a href="../docs/EWEA2014_Atortosa.pdf" target="_blank">Tortosa et al. 2014</a>) Remodeling technology developed for single-point time-extrapolations. 1D-Remodeling has proven utmost performance over more than 2000 applications all around the globe. Unlike other calibration methods based on simplified sector-wise distributions,3D-Remodeling takes particular care not to degrade the quality of the information that each source, model and observations, provides independently by mixing a spatial-temporal set of non-linear, multivariate algorithms that work exclusively in the time-series domain.
