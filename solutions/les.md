<p class="lead">Did you ever wish to have a (turbulent) measurements time-series at each turbine position of your planned or existing wind farm?<br>Now, you can get something outstandingly similar!<br>After two years of development on NCAR cutting-egde WRF-LES model, we are proud to offer you probably the most measurement-like set of synthetic wind time series currently available on the market:<br>Vortex Large Eddy Simulations (LES).</p>


## When to use LES?

When measurement time-series are missing or incomplete.

### Technical details:

- Any location world-wide, both on and off-shore.
- No measurements needed
- 1-full year period: selectable or long-term representative.
- Physically computed 10-min average records.
- Based on 3-second samples. Including maximum Gust.
- Wind speed standard deviation allowing for Turbulence Intensity calculation.
- All heights included from 50 to 150m allowing for shear and veer calculation.
- Selectable source: NCEP, NASA and ECMWF.
