<p class="lead">Did you ever wish to have a (turbulent) measurements time-series at each turbine position of your planned or existing wind farm?
Now, you can get something√Ç outstandingly similar: Vortex implementation of cutting-edge NCAR's model WRF-LES produces something outstandingly similar Vortex Large Eddy Simulations are probably the most measurement-like sets of synthetic wind time-series currently available in the market.</p>

## When to use LES?

When (turbulent) measurement time-series are missing or incomplete.

### Technical details:

- Any location world-wide, both on and off-shore.
- 100 m resolution, centered on the selected point.
- 1-full year period: selectable or long-term representative.
- Real 10-min average records.
- Based on 3-second samples. Including maximum Gust.
- Wind speed standard deviation allowing for Turbulence Intensity calculation.
- All heights included from 50 to 150m allowing for shear and veer calculation.
- Selectable source: NCEP, NASA and ECMWF.
