<p class="lead">Ocean is hard but Metocean technology can be soft. Vortex brings you access to wind & waves estimations the easy way, direct from your desktop to our computer cluster.</p>

No matter: offshore measurements are priceless. Treat online the resource and secure your offshore project development through Vortex air and sea modelling pivots. Vortex differentiating factor to what offshore is concerned is the possibility to get combined wind and waves estimations. The former, produced with the well-stablished Vortex technology, the later with cutting-egde metocean modelling tools.

##For initial project proposal and offshore zones tenders to final decision making

**Quantify the resource for any maritime domain with a verified modeling chain.**

MAP, MAST, FARM and SERIES extended offshore domains provide a complete analysis of the resource. Gain all the flexibility to redefine the perfect layout from detailed information's on wind profiles, turbulence, extremes, long-term variability and drag effect of wind farm clusters.

##When terrain is all rough sea

**How many winter days the windfarm is likely to be inaccessible? Need design precise specifications on waves topology?**

Contact us for our METOCEAN products built on the latest advances in high resolution wave and atmospheric coupled modeling. Retrieve all the marine conditions affecting project design and O&M through a reliable characterization of joint wind&wave distributions, significant wave heights and peak spectral period.
