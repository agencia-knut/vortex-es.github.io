<p class="lead">Either if they are wind farm <strong>developers</strong>, wind turbine <strong>manufacturers</strong> or specialized consultants, if they <strong>operate</strong> windfarms or trade with wind energy, if they deal with projects on or <strong>off-shore</strong>... all them consume wind and sea data from around the globe.</p>

And all them, besides measurements, have used Vortex synthetic <strong>data</strong>.

With first-hand experience of the wind industry, we have created the tools we would have liked to have had at our disposal when we were facing the same challenges as them. Fairly accurate, inexpensive  and delivered fast, our estimations help them in their everyday work.

They could also help you.
