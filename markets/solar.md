<p class="lead">Why Vortex Solar?</p> Because besides satellite data, we use mesoscale models to build our accurate, cost-effective irradiance estimates

<p class="lead">Why should that benefit me?</p> Models are our speciality enabling us to deliver global homogeneous estimates, with no gaps, at a very attractive price

<p class="lead">Why does modeling reduce prices?</p> Modeling allows the entire process to be automated, cutting costs by keeping state-of-the-art accuracy levels
