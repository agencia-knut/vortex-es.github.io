<p class="lead">Sun radiation touches every site on Earth but scattered by many diffusive agents. Vortex SOLAR helps you narrowing uncertainty on site-specific solar energy projects by means of a smart combination of satellite data and the power of well-stablished atmospheric models.</p>

##Why Vortex Solar?

At preliminary stages, for effective sites resource pre-screening our Solar maps provide a complete regional assessment of available solar energy resources in a glance.

##Dynamic information for feasibility studies

To feed yield estimation with  and without measurements Solar series spanned over several decades at high-resolution sampling, just to avoid unexpected surprises over the long-term bankability.
