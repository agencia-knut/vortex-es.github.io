### Why Vortex Solar?

Because besides satellite data, we use mesoscale models to build our accurate, cost-effective radiation estimates

### Why should that benefit me?

Models are our speciality enabling us to deliver global homogeneous long-term estimates, with no gaps, at a very attractive price

### Why does modeling reduce prices?

Modeling allows the entire process to be automated, cutting costs by keeping state-of-the-art accuracy levels
