##  Welcome to the team, SARAH!


Time goes fast! At Vortex we have just celebrated the first anniversary of our Solar service and we have some exciting news for our users:
       
-Vortex Solar has recently benefited from ingesting CM-SAF's Surface Solar Radiation Data Set Heliosat (SARAH) and Meteosat Indian Ocean Data Coverage (IODC), enhancing the service's accuracy alongside our traditional homogeneity and global coverage associated with Mesoscale modeling.
       
-PVSyst, the leading photovoltaic software, is now ingesting Vortex data which will make your everyday work-flow even easier.
       
-A new â‚¬600 annual subscription, giving access to an unlimited number of monthly TMY files, is now available for all Vortex registered users.
