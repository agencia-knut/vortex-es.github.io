##   2014 Low Wind Patterns in Turkey

Significant extremely low wind speed conditions have been detected across Turkey
throughout 2014, according to feedbacks and questions received from several VORTEX clients, and based on measurements from different wind mast sites.

In this study, long-term Vortex 9-km resolution data were employed to assess the countrywide spatial distribution for 2014 wind speed departures from long-term estimates (30-year period)

From the analysis, a clear countrywide extremely low wind speed pattern has been identified. In several areas of the country, the mean speed wind values have been 30% lower in 2014 than in the last 30 years.
