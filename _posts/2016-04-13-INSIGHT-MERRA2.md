##  Is your wind farm underperforming?

A recurring debate among wind farm owners and manufacturers revolves around whether turbines were "underperforming" or if production expectations were "too high" and the actual wind resource lower than expected (watch the video <a href="/assets/docs/insight.htm">here</a>).

Vortex <a href="/solutions/monthly.html">INSIGHT</a> may help!

By comparing recent months' data against 20-year series, INSIGHT is a site-specific Wind and Production Index specially designed to make the recurring "underperformance" debate no longer an issue.
