## Vortex FORECAST. Tomorrow's technology, today

"_A smart ensemble of several forecasts performs better than the best of its members_" EWEA Wind Power Forecasting Workshop, Rotterdam 2013.

At Vortex, we want to be your forecast provider. Even if you already have one!

Only a few months after its release, Vortex [FORECAST](http://www.vortexfdc.com/solutions/forecast.html) is already forecasting more than 1000 MW in 15 countries. High accuracy, attractive prices, customizable delivery channels and flexible input requirements are just some of the factors behind this success.

Now, you can easily check forecast accuracy for yourself by logging into Vortex Interface and comparing FORECAST Sample to real-time measurements from [Sotavento](http://www.sotaventogalicia.com/en) wind farm, on-line.

Please, contact us if you are interested in arranging a pilot to forecast your specific existing or planned projects.
