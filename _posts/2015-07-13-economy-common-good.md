## Vortex and the Economy for the Common Good

Besides leading our Solar Department, Patrícia (photo) is also Director of Happiness at Vortex and today she is happy since, according to Vortex policy, she has her birthday free to spend with her 2-years old child. This is one of the implemented measures that have awarded Vortex the 2014 Prize <a href="http://w110.bcn.cat/portal/site/UsosDelTemps/menuitem.7e04b1462441477cf740f740a2ef8a0c/?vgnextoid=11ded9634264c410VgnVCM1000001947900aRCRD&vgnextfmt=formatDetall&vgnextchannel=e5cdfd7f29217310VgnVCM10000072fea8c0RCRD&lang=en_GB" target="_blank">Innovative Company in Conciliation and Time</a>, granted by Barcelona Council (<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEHhqbvcd84 target=“_blank”>video</a>).

You may think that the above has nothing to do with you as Vortex customer but, according to the reputed economist Christian Felber's <a href="https://www.ecogood.org/en" target="_blank">Economy for the Common Good</a>, companies will be evaluated in the future by their contribution to the wealthiness of society as a whole (including their own workers). Should you have any question about Vortex happiness policy? please, <a href=mailto:patricia.puig@vortex.es?subject=ECG>contact Patricia</a>.
