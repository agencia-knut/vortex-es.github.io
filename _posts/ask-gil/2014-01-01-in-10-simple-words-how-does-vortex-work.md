# In "10" simple words, how does Vortex work?

Vortex uses a supercomputer cluster to run a non-linear flow model (WRF) that scales large atmospheric patterns (NCAR-NCEP) down to fine spatial resolutions (SRTM), generating simulated wind data suitable to be used as an alternative to actual wind data where and when no measurements are as yet available.
