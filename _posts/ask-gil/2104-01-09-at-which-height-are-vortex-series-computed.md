#At which height are Vortex SERIES computed?

Vortex SERIES are delivered at any height between 50 and 150m a.g.l. However, be aware than SERIES are a Mesoscale product of 3km-resolution, thus not directly comparable against actual measurements at a particular point and height but designed for MCP (correlation) purposes only.

If you intend to compare modeling results against actual measurements you should simulate the atmosphere down to the Microscale. Our Microscale products MAST & FARM do contain modeling effects down to the 100m resolution and, depending on the terrain, many phenomena may occur between the 3km and 100m scales.
