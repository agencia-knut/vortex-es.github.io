#Does Vortex produce reliable results within a forest?

Vortex MAST results have been compared fairly successfully against user measurements taken inside or near a forest after certain precautions have been taken:

Vortex land use data comes from satellite information. Such information can distinguish between different types of trees but says nothing about the treesâ€™ height. Depending on the forest, it is advisable to transport the calculation height down to take into account the canopy of the forest. For example, if trees are 15m high, measurements at 60m will better match model results at 45m. This kind of corrections must be performed by the client when information about the forest is available.
