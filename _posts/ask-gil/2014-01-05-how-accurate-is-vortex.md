# How accurate is Vortex?

Current Vortex system accuracy values are presented here. These values change periodically thanks to the feedback of our users, who compare Vortex simulation results against their good-quality data.

Our approach is risky but honest. Vortex is currently the only company on the market that allows for a systematical comparison of our model results against your measurements for you to gain confidence in the reliability of our simulations first hand.
