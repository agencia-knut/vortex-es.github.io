##   Vortex FORECAST helps India’s wind industry to forecast wind farms.

Vortex and NIWE will provide electricity generation forecasts down to a fifteen minute resolution up to 10 days ahead; with bulletins being revised every three hours to provide accurate predictions that enhance grid stability and energy security.

The pilot project launched on 13 May by the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) will help Tamil Nadu’s state-owned electricity generation and distribution utility, Tangedco, better manage fluctuations in energy generation from the region’s 7.4 GW of installed wind capacity.
