# Results of validation of vortex in India


One of [VORTEX](http://www.vortex.es/?utm_source=Vortex+users&utm_campaign=9d7f9c6c08-Turkish_Validation10_24_2013&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_76f80cadf1-9d7f9c6c08-)’s overriding aims has always been to provide the most accurate data in the wind industry. We are therefore constantly working to improve our technology; validating outputs against reliable observed data generated by companies in the sector.
 
Over the last 12 months, we have been testing our Vortex MAST product at hundreds of sites across the world, including India. The [document](http://www.vortex.es/docs/IndiaVORTEXvalidation.pdf?utm_source=Vortex+users&utm_campaign=9d7f9c6c08-Turkish_Validation10_24_2013&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_76f80cadf1-9d7f9c6c08-) attached presents the results of testing in India. Conclusions on this validation have been most satisfactory and in line with the results of tests at other locations around the world.
 
We will continue to validate our products and enhancements thereof. If you are interested in participating in future validation processes, please do not hesitate to [contact us](/about-us/).
